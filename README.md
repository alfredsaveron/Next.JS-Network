## 💁‍♂️ So, it's completely open-source now?

- Yes. Well, I'm not working on Next.JS right now and I'd like you show my first "designed" website in a JavaScript Framework.

## 🤦‍♂️It's not same as the HTML one!

- Although, I'm doing new changes in the HTML one, so you have to change it. If you want to use the HTML design, you have to make new changes in Next.JS template.

### Reach out my social medias for getting support to the templates!
